                    Reasons I like Astronomy:
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Astronomy is<strong><em> VERY INTERISTING</strong></em> and there is always something new to learn</li>
                    <p>There is always something new to find in the sky. With so many Meesier object<br>
                     to look for it would take years for an amature like my self to be able to see them all.<br>
                    With every new season of the year the view in the night sky changes and there are different<br>
                constilations to see.</p>

                <li>Telescopes are <strong><em>FUN</em></strong> to use.</li>
                <p>Telescopes are great to use and learn about. They allow you to see things thousands of light<br>
                years away.And even closer objects are so much more interesting through one.Just  looking at the<br>
                 craters on the moon or the rings of Saturn through a telescope is amazing. </p>
                </ol>

        I should also mention that if<br>
        You think you might like to get into<br>
        astronomy, your local astronomical society<br>
        Is a great place to start.

                    Reasons I like Computers:
                </h3>
<ol>
    <li>Computers are<em><strong> FASINATING </em></strong>creatures</li>
    <p>Since the very first little Tandy that I bought at RAdio shack many <br>
        years ago I have just been in awe of them and one has always been in<br>
        my home.I haven't had the time to learn all the programming and such<br>
        that I would have liked to in the past but I am hoping to make up for that<br>
        now.
    </p>
    <li>Computers make the world a <em><strong> SMALLER </strong></em>place</li>
    <p>I love being able to keep up with family and friends around the world.<br>
        Before the internet I wouldn't have been able to have met all these <br>
        wonderfull people in many countries that I now call my friends.<br>
        I may never get to actually visit them but it seems like we visit all the<br>
        time on the computer.

</ol>


<ol>
<li> I <em><strong>LOVE</strong></em> to eat good food!</li>
<p>Not really a lot of explanation need there, Who dosen't<br>
love to eat good food.</p>
<li>It's like and <em><strong>ADVENTURE</strong></em> to try new recipes.</li>
<p>It's fun to search the internet for new recipes. I also  love to share<br>
good ones when I find them. It is a thrill when someone tries something I <br>
have made and then says"you have to give me your recipe".</p>
